# Welcome to my nook!
I'm currently learning about fullstack, UI and UX.
I'm always eager to translate apps and projects to Finnish (especially during Hacktoberfest 🎃).

[Database of All Things](https://github.com/minna-xD/dboat-fullstack)

## Translating everything, one repo at a time
My contributions in Hacktoberfest have been mainly localizations. Each year I've managed to reach the required number of accepted pull requests – and yes, I do have the t-shirts to prove it.
